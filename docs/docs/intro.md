## How to use these docs

Analyzer has been designed to be as simple and easy to use as possible, but
setting up accounts, installing expert advisor, and customizing dashboards can
get a little confusing at times. These docs should provide everything you might
need to setup and use Analyzer effectively. If you don't find what your are
looking for, please open a GitHub issue, or send an email to
