# Account Setup

To get started with Analyzer, you'll first want to sign up and add your first
trading account. If you have more than one MetaTrader account, you'll be able to
add multiple accounts inside of Analyzer for each of your MetaTrader accounts,
but let's start by getting your first account setup.

## Sign up

:::caution

Analyzer is currently in private beta. Before creating an account, please email
[Mark Skelton](mailto:mdskelton99@gmail.com) to request access to the beta.

:::

To sign up, head on over to https://analyzer.mskelton.dev/signup; provide your
name, email, and a password; and click **Sign up** to complete the registration
process.

## Add your first trading account

After signing up, you should notice that the dashboard is a little boring. Don't
worry, that's just because there aren't any accounts to pull data from. To add
your first trading account, click the **Add account** button. Fill out the
details of your account, which you can change later, and save your new account.

After you add the account, you should see it show on the accounts list along
with a unique token for your account. Go ahead and copy this token and continue
to the next step of the setup, the EA installation.
