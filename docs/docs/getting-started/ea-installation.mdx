# EA Installation

Analyzer uses a expert advisor (EA) to publish trades from your MetaTrader 5
terminal to Analyzer. As trades are ingested, Analyzer will generate metrics
such as current balance, profit over time, daily max drawdown, and more. These
metrics are used to power charts and figures you select on your dashboards.

## Download

To setup the expert advisor, first download the
[latest release from GitHub](https://github.com/mskelton/analyzer/releases/latest).
Once downloaded, place it in the appropriate path for your operating system.
